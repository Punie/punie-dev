# :tada: Initial Commit

It's been more than a year now that I wanted to try and start a blog. But being
a tad OCD means I could never settle on a title, domain name, theme or even
color scheme for my code snippets (yeah, it was that bad).

Anyway, I feel it's time for me to take a leap of faith and don't fret too much
on such matters and most importantly, start doing some writin' yo!

So if you like to read about some niche experimental language you've never
heared of, decypher some big scary mathematical formulas I don't even always
understand myself, or just follow along as I talk endlessly about type systems
and other controversial subjects in software engineering (like semicolons, TDD,
or comments in code), let's roll!
